\section{Project presentation}
In this section, we will talk about current state, what's wrong with it, and suggest ways to make things better and help the business do well.
%In this section, we will outline the current state, critique it, and propose solutions to address challenges and improve enterprise performance.
\subsection{Study of the existing}
Public private partnerships PPPs have become very important in the global infrastructure sector. They help reduce costs and address economic challenges in areas like transportation and energy.
%Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have indeed emerged as indispensable options in the global infrastructure environment, offering promising solutions to lower infrastructure costs and overcome economic constraints in sectors such as transport , energy, and others. 
\vskip 0.5cm
However, using the traditional methods to see if PPP projects are possible can cause some problems. These methods can be tiring, costly, and rely too much on experts, old data, and basic financial models. They provide some useful information but may not be advanced enough to handle the complexity and uncertainty of infrastructure.
%However, traditional methods of feasibility assessment for PPP projects result in distinct inefficiencies. These methods are often laborious, expensive, rely too heavily on expert judgment, historical data, and simple financial models Despite providing some valuable insight, often these methods lack the necessary sophistication required to effectively deal with the complexity and uncertainty of infrastructure.
\vskip 0.5cm
Additionally, as the number of project files and documents increased, organizations like Jade Advisory realized they need for better ways to work together and manage resources. That's why they started using platforms like OneDrive for easier teamwork and improved management. Jade Advisory decided to use ChatGPT as an AI assistant in their work, which can help them better conduct studies and manage project documents. This accreditation involves tasks like reviewing documents, feasibility studies, and asking for advice from experts.
%Additionally, as the volume of project files and documents increased, organizations such as Jade Advisory recognized the need for advanced collaboration and resource management solutions and therefore moved to platforms such as OneDrive in order with easier teamwork and better management. However, Jade Advisory chose to incorporate ChatGPT as an AI assistant in their workflow,which could strengthen their ability to conduct feasibility studies and manage project documentation more efficiently. This accreditation includes activities, including review of documents, feasibility studies, and seeking expert recommendations.
\subsection{criticism of the existing}
% Jade advisory think highly of data privacy, due to sensitive and proprietary information included in its project files .Therefore ,OneDrive isn't a good choice because it is developed and managed by Microsoft. Even if your data is encrypted, Microsoft can get access to it.Otherwise ,communicating documents with chatgpt not only could present  confidentiality issues but also its very slow in term of response speed while dealing with multi-documents on account of the documents curation.
% It's also important to consider the context in which ChatGPT is used and to verify the information it provides through independent sources when necessary, especially in situations where the accuracy and reliability of the information are paramount.
% Jade Advisory lacks a dedicated engineering team or prior expertise. Consequently, ChatGPT might pose a risk by relying on independent sources for information, potentially leading to distractions in its operations, especially in situations where the accuracy and reliability of the information are paramount.

Although public private partnerships PPPs offer promising solutions for building infrastructure, traditional feasibility study methods have many criticisms because they are inefficient and have limitations.
%Although public-private partnerships (PPPs) offer promising solutions in terms of infrastructure development, conventional feasibility study methods face several important criticisms stems from the inefficiencies and various limitations of the current methods.
\vskip 0.5cm
First, using old methods to do feasibility studies with lots of manual work is really hard. These methods are usually slow, require lots of work, and are prone to mistakes. They also cause delays and inefficiencies in decision-making. Relying on expert opinions can lead to subjective and biased results, instead of objective and thorough analysis.
%First, the reliance on traditional methods for conducting feasibility studies, characterized by manual work, presents major challenges. These methods are often time-consuming, labour-intensive and error-prone, in addition to delays and inefficiencies in decision-making processes, their reliance on expert judgment as the primary source of insight encourages subjectivity and bias, and destroys objectivity and robust analysis.
\vskip 0.5cm
Besides, traditional approaches prioritize economic and neglect other important things like social impact, environmental sustainability, and technical development. This limited perspective hinders a full understanding of project feasibility and overlooks potential risks and opportunities that may come from non financial factors.
%Besides, traditional approaches prioritize economic considerations while ignoring other important feasibility considerations, such as social and economic impact, environmental sustainability, and technical development This narrow view limits the broader understanding of project feasibility and ignores potential risks and opportunities that may arise from non-financial factors.
\vskip 0.5cm
Howerver, The absence of automation for everyday tasks like creating reports still causes problems with projects and makes stakeholders less productive.
%However, the lack of automation for common tasks such as report generation continues to contribute to inefficient projects and decrease productivity for stakeholders.
\vskip 0.5cm
Also, ChatGPT's lack of user interaction makes it less efficient and slows down decision-making. Participants may have trouble understanding and using the information given by the AI assistant, which could decrease their effectiveness.
%Furthermore, ChatGPT’s limited user interactivity hinders efficiency and decision making. Participants may have difficulty accessing and interpreting the insights provided by the AI assistant, limiting their ability to fully utilize them.
\vskip 0.5cm
Moreover, the limited access to ChatGPT makes it hard for people with technical skills or disabilities to fully take part in the study. However, the way ChatGPT deals with issues relating to the project, wich is careful and respectful of privacy concerns. Without following strict safety rules, people involved may hesitate to work with AI, which can make the feasibility study process less trustworthy and efficient.
%Furthermore, the limited accessibility of ChatGPT creates barriers for participants with technical skills or disabilities, preventing them from fully participating in the feasibility study process. Nevertheless, how ChatGPT handles related to the project is sensitive to privacy and confidentiality concerns arise. Without strict safety protocols, stakeholders may be reluctant to interact with AI, undermining the integrity and effectiveness of the feasibility study process.
\vskip 0.5cm
In summary, current methods for assessing the feasibility of PPPs have problems like being inefficient, subjective, and only focusing on economic factors. These limits, with difficulties linked to combining data, automating tasks, engaging users, making things easy to access, and protecting privacy. They emphasize the need for a big change in how we make decisions, moving towards more thorough and objective methods.
%In summary, existing feasibility assessment methods in PPPs suffer from inefficiencies, subjectivity, and narrow attention to economic considerations. These constraints, with challenges related to data integration, automation, user interaction, accessibility and privacy. They highlight the necessity for a paradigm shift towards more comprehensive, objective and integrated approaches to ensure robust decision-making.
